## 2. How to Play ##
### 2.1. Overview ###
In Zonelink, you are provided a chance to manage the cities' development of the world. Your assignment starts with a primary city and you can build factories, schools and hospitals on it. Each of these accessories contributes to the city's development.

After building some of them, the city will start working. Then you need to help other cities by establishing links between them. By developing cities work in partnership and a sharp strategy in distributing pieces to upgrade your cities, you can get a higher development while competing with other three players and finally achieve the Millennium Development Goals.

### 2.2. Starting a game ###
To start a new game, click the Play button on the main menu.

Each player will be assigned with a random city and a random color at 4 different corners of the map.

### 2.3. Accessories ###
Depending on the cities' scale, 1 to 4 accessories can be built in city.

There are four kinds of accessories: lumber factory, oil refinery, school and hospital.
Cities need resources to work. Factories can get them from nature.

  * Lumber factory is used to exploit lumber and provide lumber for building new accessories.
  * Oil refinery is used to open up oilfields and produces energy supply for the city. This kind of factory produce more CO2 than any other accessories. However it can be upgraded to biofuel factory, which is a renewable clean technology. Biofuel factory converts food into oil.
  * School can teach the citizens and speedup the development.
  * Hospital can provide health care and help the city reduce damage from disasters.
> Both school and hospital eats food.
  * Farm can grow food. To build a new farm you need the yellow goal piece. Put 4 yellow goal pieces in the positions around the city.

To build the other accessories just choose one accessory and click the Build button on the cityâ€™s construction panel.

### 2.4. Goal Pieces ###
Goal Pieces are symbolic representations of new technologies, knowledge and developments that can be used to upgrade your city's accessories. The cities managed by you can produce goal pieces. At first the pieces are produced in fragments, the fragements with the same color can be put together and they will become round pieces. Store them in the containers at the bottom of the screen.

The goal pieces can be used to either establish links with other cities or upgrade your accessoies, by puting them in the positions around the city.

### 2.5. Links ###
The links between cities represent the cooperation of cities all around the world and promote global partnership. Once the link between two cities is established, there will be resources transported between the two cities. The moving red bright dots represent the transportation of oil, the green ones stand for lumber and the yellow ones stand for foodstuff. One city with high-tec factories can serve those cities linked with it.

To establish links, choose one city and select a corresponding goal piece, then put the piece in the right position of your city.

### 2.6. Natural disasters ###
Accessories can speed up your development, but at the same time they produce CO2. Too much CO2 may cause disasters which damage your city and lead a development loss. If the damage that the disaster brings is too severe, the city may be out of control. You are not allowed to link with it before a ceratin period of time.

To reduce the CO2 emission and make your city develop more efficient. To upgrade your accessories, collecting all the pieces that matches the color of the positions around your city.

## 3. Advanced Choices ##
### 3.1. Making your strategy ###
Every player has two main indicators on the screen: Development progress bar and CO2 emission bar. During the game the players need to maximize your overall development degree of all your cities. Here are some useful tips:

  * Cities with different accessories usually plays different role in the city network. Think wisely when choosing what assessory to build.
  * Each accessory cost some amount of lumber. You won't be able to build any accessory if there's no enough lumber left. So remember keep track of the lumber storage. The bright moving dots tells you how much resources the city have.
> Sometimes you find a accessory is building very slowly. even the progress circle doesn't keep going. That means the city does't have enough lumber for the construction currently. To continue you have to bring resources from nearby city.
  * The resource demand of a city depends on the scale of it, small cities are easier to be linked with since they need fewer resources.
  * City with a lot of resources nearby are wanted.

### 3.2. Partnerships ###
Partnership plays an essential role in Zonelink. You can establish a partnership by establishing links or exchanging goal pieces.

By establishing links with cities, there'll be resources transported between the cities and can provide your cities enough resources to develop.
It's never said that building all kinds of accessories will develop better. Because accessories will use up the resources.

To exchange goal pieces with other players, you need to put a goal piece in the exchange box at the right bottom of screen. Then the goal piece in the exchange box will get out and can be used by you.
