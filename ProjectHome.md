> ZoneLink(v.1337) is a realtime strategy game setting in the world of cartoon. In the game, cities are lively characters on our home world - the earth. Cities are divided to two sides, The Protectors - good cities and The Ruiners - the bad cities. The player takes over a City of Green at the start of the game. He/she has to help and transform the rest bad cities controlled by other seven computer players to good ones.

> Good cities produce resources balls that represent the sustainable energy, education and health resource. The city will throw the balls to other cities with your command. In this way the player send the balls. And the balls will transform the bad city, make it under your control at the same time.

> Bad cities produce dirty energy, disease and violence balls, and they affect other cities the same way like good ones.

> The cartoon-based style and the vivid, lively characters and playing balls make ZoneLink very fun and unique. Beside this, the Real-Time Strategy style challenges the player to keep a sharp mind in transforming cities and making use of resources.
