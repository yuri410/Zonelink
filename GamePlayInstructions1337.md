ZoneLink is perfectly playable without reading this manual, but it may be helpful to have things written out for reference and some of the features are not explicitly mentioned in the game. Here follows an overview of things you should know.

## Game Concepts ##
In ZoneLink, there are seven city types. We divided into two sides and a neutral city.
The first side, The Protectors, consists of green, educational and healthy city, while the second side is The Ruiners, represents oil, violent and diseased city. The player will always be The Protectors and computer players will be The Ruiners. In the game, you will compete with other seven computer players at the same time.

## City Character and Sides ##
We use cartoon and lively characters to represent those seven types city. Now, we introduce these seven cities and their productions.

## Neutral ##
7.	Neutral City

![http://lrvbsvnicg.googlecode.com/files/con_neutral.png](http://lrvbsvnicg.googlecode.com/files/con_neutral.png)

Neutral city is a unique city. There are some neutral city on the earth, many between your city and enemy city. So before you help that city, you need to get the neutral city first. Therefore neutral city doesn’t produce any resource ball.


## Game Strategy ##
Exploit Natural Resource
On the earth, there are many natural resource including oil and wood. In order to develop your city, you need to exploit natural resource. There is a small and lively harvester packing in the city. This harvester is used to load natural resource. The player can dispatch the harvester to the forest for wood. After the harvester is full loaded, it will back to city. So city can use resource to produce resource ball.

### Transform city ###
You can help The Ruiners- the bad cities by sending resource ball. Your city will throw a ball to a nearby city and the rest cities will pass the ball. Only the green element ball can transform bad city to a good one. Other two element balls can also transferred. Education ball will slow down and decrease bad city’s development level. Medical ball will have no use in enemy's city. But it have high HP and draws damage. After you helped a city, it will become your side city, at the same time it will transform its character into the corresponding city character of your side. For example, after you help an Oil City, its character will transform into City of Green, Disease City will transform into City of Health, and Violence City will transform into City of Scholarship.

### Game Goal ###
In the beginning, you are assigned to the Protector side and control a green city. The goal of ZoneLink is to help 15 cites. So you can exploit natural resource and transfer resource ball to help city.  After you help 15 cities , you win the game.
